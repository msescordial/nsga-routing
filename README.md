An implementation of NSGA-II in MATLAB by Mostapha Kalami Heris (https://yarpiz.com/56/ypea120-nsga2) was adopted and modified for the bus routing problem. For the $k$-shortest path method and Dijkstra's algorithm, the codes from Wang (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5550-dijkstra-shortest-path-routing) was used.
